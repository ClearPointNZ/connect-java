Tile: holds core Java plugins shared between Java and Groovy (and other langs)

== Description
This holds the core JVM plugins that ensure consistency across all JVM related projects. 

A few notes:

- JUnit and Spec style tests are supported in Surefire
- Source and Target platforms are fixed to Java 1.8. No earlier version is supported.
- Licenses are reported on but lack of them does not cause a build failure
- Moderizer will report if you are using old style code or invalid / deprecated code

There will be other candidates (e.g. OWASP CVE checker) turning up over time.
