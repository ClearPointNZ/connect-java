= connect-java
All Java artifacts related to the Connect project.

== Description
As part of support from the Maven Release plugin for sub-folders in Maven Releases, we have shifted to
a single repository for all Java related artifacts.

This includes our libraries, maven plugins, composites (third party dependencies) and tiles (plugins).

This is intended to make it easier to onboard new people, do commits across artifacts when required, create more
finely grained artifacts.

Most of these artifacts stem from logging, tracing and wiring requirements to speed up the performance of Microservices
written in Java.
