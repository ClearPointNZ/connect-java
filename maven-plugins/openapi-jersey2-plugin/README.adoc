= connect-openapi-jersey2

Converts swagger/openapi yaml or json files into JAX-RS apis based on Jersey2

= changes from v1.x

The 2.x line adds support for openapi v3 using the openapi v3 plugin and
extensions for Jersey 2.26+.

It differs from the standard by using common support files, separating the
implementation and interface - so the interface is a standard Jersey
annotated interface that can be easily used in tests or used in dynamic
generated proxy if desired. Thus it provides a bridge between old and new.

It expects you will also use the library as support files.
