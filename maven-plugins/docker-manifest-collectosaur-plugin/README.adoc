= Docker-Manifest-Collectosaur-Plugin

== Quick Start ==

This example shows how to build a manifest of a reactor project with `Babyosaur` and `Mamaosaur`.

In this quick start, you will:

** Use `Babyosaur` to create a manifest for a single module.
** Use `Mamasaur` to aggregate all the manifest files from the child modules.

The **Maven** project is set up with a parent POM ([`pom.xml`](pom.xml)), and the module POMs ([`module-1/pom.xml`](module-1/pom.xml) and [`module-2/pom.xml`](module-2/pom.xml)) defines the build configuration specific to that module.

----
project-foo
  +- pom.xml (This is your parent pom.)
  +- module-1
  |    +- pom.xml (This is your module pom for the module-1 etc.)
  |    +- ...
  +- module-2
  |    +- pom.xml
  |    +- ...
  +- extra1.json
  +- ...
  +- target
  |    +- connect-manifest.json
----

=== Setup ===

`Babysaur` is declared inside the child module POMs' build. You can define:

 ** baseImageName
 ** fullImageName
 ** serviceName

        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

=== Build the project ===

[source,sh]
----
mvn package
----

When Maven **package** phase is executed, Maven first builds all of the submodule POMs, Maven then locates all of the manifest files and copies all of these meta into a file named **connect-manifest.json** under the build folder.

An example of the generated manifest yaml file looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
service1:
  image:
    prefix: 'blah/service1'
    tag: '1.0'
service2:
  image:
    prefix: 'blah/service2'
    tag: '1.0'

== Goal: Diffosaur
`Diffosaur` is a tool that helps you to build a set of modules. Say for example, you only want to build the modules that have changes.
This goal will output three files - diffosaur.txt|sh|bat, which contains a list of module names. This file then can then be used to pass to Maven so it will only build the artefacts that specified (using flag `-pl`).

See *extended configuration* section below for a comprehensive list of configuration options.

To use this plugin declare the plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<execution>
    <id>diffosaur</id>
    <phase>initialize</phase>
    <goals>
        <goal>diffosaur</goal>
    </goals>
</execution>
----

== Goal:Deployosaur

This goal merges current build data with manifest of previous deployments if we are not on a special branch, known as the 'golden branch' - which by default is "master".

This goal is designed to take the input of the build and:

* output a yaml manifest file for `helm` for this deployment container
* output a docker manifest JSON file that can be attached as metadata for the next phase (a) if this container works
* If `buildNumber` and `deployContainerTagOutputFile` are defined, output a file which we write the tag name that was used.
This allows us to pass it onto the Retagosaur.
* write system properties: [$collectorsaurmanifest, $collectorsaurBranch, $collectorsaurSha, $collectorsaurTimestamp]

See *extended configuration* section below for a comprehensive list of configuration options.

To use this plugin declare the plugin:

        <outputJsonManifestFile>src/main/resources/manifest.json</outputJsonManifestFile>
        <pullRequest>My PR</pullRequest>
        <sha>12345</sha>
        <branch>monsters</branch>
    </configuration>
</execution>

=== Docker Tag Format

Docker tag value is generated using following format:
`timestamp.build.project-env.cluster.deploy.timestamp`

For example, our build tags for the deploy container look like this:

`1540501501119.7`

when they succeed they look like this:

`1540501501119.7.ci.nonprod.deploy.1540502359372.final.mergeSha`

(where `mergeSha` is the sha returned from the repository when something is merged.

`1540501501119.7.ci.nonprod.deploy.1540502359372`

(where the mergeSha is not provided, this is the tag of the promotable deployment image)

== Goal:Retagosaur
This goal will retag an existing tag, copying the manifest over. It is used once all of the e2e tests pass
and we are ready for an environment to be tagged.

It can be used one of two ways

.. using a mergeSha, which will add a new manifest with that sha so
it can be found by display tools (like the Connect Dashboard) to track back exactly where in the history it was
merged/squashed/rebased.
.. without a merge sha, which will cause it to create a .deploy.TIMESTAMP manifest which is intended for
the e2e run to indicate this is a "golden image".
