== Sanitize DB

- Create an SNS topic (in our case called `global-rds-event-topic`) and subscribe a queue to this
(in our case `global-rds-event-queue`).
- Create an *Event Subscription* for all instance events to the topic, and another one for all
  snapshot events to the queue.

Eventually this will also have support for Aurora Clusters.

Make sure only the topic can post to the queue
unsure how to prevent others from posting to SNS
