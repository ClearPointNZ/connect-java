= connect-java-serverlet-spring

== Description
The code in this artifact is designed to be used specifically with Spring versions 4.3 and
above.

=== Module
A _module_ is analogous to a Guice module, and is designed to consist of the registration of a number
of beans. Spring generally doesn't care about which interfaces a bean is tied to, once registered it
will find the bean with all of the interfaces it uses.

Spring has this "concept" by simply allowing a Module to have an `@Import` statement that holds multiple
beans to register (and even cascading registration) so the concept is generally of limited usefulness.

However, pair this with the https://github.com/rvowles/gen-code-scanner[`gen-code-scanner`] plugin, this
allows scan based wiring at runtime, which is an enormous performance boost over runtime scanning.

The reason for this is covered more in the Connect CD principles documentation.

=== ServletModule
This allows a number of different ways of registering servlets. The JerseyModule in
`connect-java-servlet-spring-jersery` descends from it. It allows registering of servlets
through a simple fluid syntax in a `Consumer<Definition>` callback or detection of `@WebServlet`
 or `@WebFilter` annotations.
