= connect-runnable-war

== Description
Forked from University of Auckland Group Applications package https://github.com/uoa-group-applications/common-runnable-war[common-runnable-war]

Expects its static "run" method to be called with or without a war file attached. If no war file is attached, it will
use the "dev" `webdefault.xml` instead of the "prod" `webdefault.xml`

The runtime scan can be skipped if a compile time prescan generated file `META-INF/resources/preScanned` is detected,
and the app is running from inside a war file.

`META-INF/resources/preScanned` is expected to be in the format of `keyword=path`. The path is expected to be normalised
the root of the resources i.e. `file:/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/web.xml`

.Sample META-INF/resources/preScanned

 ----	
 webxml=file:/WEB-INF/web.xml
 fragment=jar:file:/jars/fragment.jar!/META-INF/web-fragment.xml
