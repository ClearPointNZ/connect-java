= Prometheus Jersey Support

== Descrption
This repository adds in tracking functionality via Prometheus to Jersey applications. It directly
supports Prometheus and _nothing else_. This is a deliberate decision because adding levels of configuration
and indirection leads to poor performance, something we are trying to avoid by using Prometheus!

By default this library will wrap all your JAX-RS runctions with Histogram timings and it will also track
counters of 2xx, 3xx, 4xx and 5xx counters.

The "all" is controlled by a system property (true/false) of `prometheus.jersey.all` or environment variable
`PROMETHEUS_JERSEY_ALL`. You can also create an instance of the *Feature* and set it directly, along with the prefix.

The _prefix_ allows you to prefix all of your metrics - allowing you to essentially group them. This is controlled
by `prometheus.jersey.prefix` or environment variable `PROMETHEUS_JERSEY_PREFIX` (or again, create the instance yourself).


The name of the metric is automatically generated from the method name (the class is behind a proxy, making it hard
to get to) and the help is the declaration style of the API call - e.g. `/events/{guid}` instead of the actual guid.
This is cached so it only happens once.

If you wish to override the name, simply add:

----
@Prometheus(name="metric_name", help="your help")
----

which ever is left blank gets the default name (so you can leave help blank and it will get the default help).

To then use it in your Jersey application, add in:

----
register(PrometheusDynamicFeature.class);
----

It is, of course, released in Apache Maven Central, so just add the dependency to your pom:

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.bluetrainsoftware</groupId>
	<artifactId>prometheus-jersey</artifactId>
  <version>2.1</version>
</dependency>
----
