= connect-jetty-redis

== Description
This provides a Redis backed version of the SessionDataStore for Jetty 9.4.x. The API is
quite different so needed to be re-written.

== Installation Instructions

If you are using the connect-runnable-war, then

- include this artifact in your dependencies
- specify redis.port and redis.host in your system properties

The plugin detects these two and wires itself in.

If you are not using the connect-runnable-war, then you need to manually replace the SessionDataStore,
have a look at the `RedisSessionDataStoreConfiguration` class for details.

=== Open Tracing

It is worth noting that the OpenTracing API is plugged into this implementation. If you do not wire up that
API, you will be able to ignore it - you will have an extra dependency in your list. You cannot exclude that
dependency otherwise the code will fail, but it will do nothing,
