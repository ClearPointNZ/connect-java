= env-logging

This artifact is designed to collect information at startup time from the environment and make it available on every
logging request.

It is expected to be configured by a system property:

----
connect.logging.environment=NAME=log-key,NAME=log-key
----

an example might be the Kubernetes node that you are running on. In which case if you expose that information
via the Deployment as, say, `MY_KUBERNETES_NODE`

----
connect.logging.environment=MY_KUBERNETES_NODE=kubernetes.node
----

will cause the Connect logger to read the node name in at the start, cache it and then put it into every line
in your log file.
