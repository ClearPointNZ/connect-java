== openapi v3 support classes

Many of the openapi v3 files are weirdly generated for each swagger file
you feed it. This especially becomes a pain to genericize and manage.

This simply extracts them all into one place and makes the Auth functionality
more sensible generally. 

=== changes
* 1.4 release contains a new annotation used by the 6.2 generator, ReturnStatus. If the returnType
is a 2xx and it isn't a 200, this gets added. You _must_ add the ReturnStatusContainerResponseFilter
to your Jersey context for this to actually work however, otherwise it will just get ignored.
